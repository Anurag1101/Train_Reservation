# Train Reservation System

## Overview
This Python-based Train Reservation System allows users to simulate booking train tickets. The program asks for passenger details, such as name, age, gender, source and destination stations, and coach type (AC, Sleeper, or Unreserved). It then provides a confirmed berth, coach number, and calculates the fare based on the coach type.

## Features
- Simulates ticket booking with user inputs.
- Provides random berth and coach number assignments.
- Calculates fare based on the type of coach (AC, Sleeper, or Unreserved).
- Includes a greeting message from Indian Railways.
- Static methods to display welcome and farewell messages.

## How to Use
**Clone the repository**:
git clone https://github.com/Anurag1101/Train_Reservation.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd Train_Reservation

**Run the program:** Run the Python script in your terminal or Python environment:
